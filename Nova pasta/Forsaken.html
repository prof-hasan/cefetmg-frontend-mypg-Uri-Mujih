    <p>Forsaken is a is a multiplayer asymmetric horror roblox game created by Souldrivenlove. The game's playstyle consists in (up to) 8 survivors trying to win against one killer by staling time (4 minutes).Objectives are the main task to complete in a round. Objectives reduce the timer by a set time, which changes depending on what the objective and gives the survivor a specific amount of Experience and Player Points if done.
        There is currently only one objective in the game after the rework of generators.Generators are found on every map, with the number of generators being max 5. When working on the generator, the player is forced into a minigame where dots of matching color and number must be connected to each other in a grid in order to complete the minigame.For each puzzle completed, the timer will go down by 4 seconds, no matter how many generators there are in total.</p>
    <p>Currently there is a total of 10 playable survivors being them:</p>

Filling this bar grants the player their second life, however to do so, you'll have to deal 70 damage to fill it. Stats change when respawning, making Two Time have 40 HP. Two Time is also granted Speed II for 6 seconds and Weakness V for 12 seconds when respawning.
                    Upon entering LMS if this second life has not been used, instead gain (Bar% x 30-40) additional MaxHealth and Health.

Upon successfully blocking an attack, Guest 1337 has their movement speed restored, their Resistance status removed, and is given Speed I for 3s.

                        If Guest 1337 charges into a killer whom was already charged into 10 seconds prior, they will take 15 damage and the charge's effects will be nullified. Not landing a charge on an enemy inflicts Slowness II that lasts for 3 times Guest 1337's distance from the nearest killer divided by 13. Charge ends automatically if you crash into a wall.

                    Jason does a basic slash with his machete, dealing 20 damage and inflicting Bleeding I for 5s. If used while <strong>ENRAGED</strong>, Jason lunges forwarding while slashing, and the damage is increased to 25.

                    Jason winds up a strong horizontal swing to the head of his target and has a small lunge, inflicting Helpless I for 14s, and dealing 20 damage — or 35 if <strong>ENRAGED</strong> — upon contact. Regardless of if the slash lands, Jason is inflicted with Slowness I for 2s after swinging.

                    Jason does a combination of slashes — starting with two hits from his machete, then jamming his chainsaw through the victim — before kicking them to the ground and ragdolling them. Each slash deals around 1/5th of the attack's total damage, adding up to 50 in total, or 70 if Jason is <strong>ENRAGED</strong>.

                    While in effect, Jason becomes immune to stuns, has his sprinting disabled, and has his stamina slowly become capped at 70 over the course of 6.5s. The cap is removed once he leaves his <strong>ENRAGED</strong> state.

                    The lunge stops prematurely upon collision with a survivor or obstacle. Colliding with a survivor during the lunge causes them to take 25 damage, alongside applying Burning I for 10s. This deals a total of 40 damage.
